Q3> Give an example of an application simulating an environment of  context aware computing and justify.

The ParcTab System

The ParcTab system was developed at the beginning of the 90's at the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center. The system is based on palm-sized wireless ParcTab computers and an infrared communication system that links them to each other and to desktop computers through a local area network (LAN) [25]. The system was developed to experiment with ubiquitous computing and context-awareness in an office environment.
The ParcTab (figure 2) is a small wireless palm-sized computer with three finger operated buttons on the grip and a touch sensitive screen (128x64) and a speaker. It was continually connected via an infrared-based cellular network to a central server.  Each office room had a transceiver connected to the LAN communicating with the ParcTabs. The total bandwidth of one such cell was 19 200 bps. The ParcTab system could continuously know where each ParcTab was, e.g. which ones were in the same room and notify applications of location changes. The first ParcTab system was released in March 1993 having around 20 users at Xerox PARC. The year after that a new optimized version was released with approximately 40 users. 
 
The ParcTab worked as a mobile personal digital office assistant. There were dozens of applications developed for and tested with it. Some of them were not really context-aware, including among others possibility to view emails, personal calendar information, weather information from the Internet and the local weather station. There were also several ParcTab applications implemented for context-aware experimentation. These included:

Presenting information about the room the user was in. The information could be shown automatically, or by user request. E.g. when the user was at the library information about the library was displayed. [2]
Helping the user find the most convenient local resource, e.g. the nearest printer. The ParcTab could present a menu with all available printers and the distance of each of them from the users current room. [2]
Attaching a certain UNIX directory to a certain room. When the user enters the room all the files in the directory are shown. The directory is writeable by everyone, so anybody can post a note in a room by creating a file within its directory. [2]

 
Locating other persons carrying a ParcTab. The location of the persons was shown a map on a desktop computer. [26]

 
Using the ParcTab as a remote control with different control choices in different rooms. [25]
The ParcTab applications used following types of context: location, the presence of other mobile devices, time, nearby non-mobile machines and the state of the network file system [25].
