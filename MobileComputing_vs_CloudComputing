Q2> Differentiate between mobile and cloud computing

Cloud Computing:
•	Cloud computing is an expression used to describe a variety of computing concepts that involve a large number of computers connected through a real-time communication network such as the Internet.[1] 
•	In science, cloud computing is a synonym for distributed computing over a network, and means the ability to run a program or application on many connected computers at the same time.
•	 The phrase also more commonly refers to network-based services, which appear to be provided by real server hardware, and are in fact served up by virtual hardware, simulated by software running on one or more real machines.
•	 Such virtual servers do not physically exist and can therefore be moved around and scaled up (or down) on the fly without affecting the end user - arguably, rather like a cloud.

•	Cloud computing, allows you to store your files and folders in a “cloud” area on the Internet, allowing you access to all of your files and folders wherever you are in the world – but you do need a physical device with Internet access to access it.

•	cloud computing offers enterprises the freedom to access hosted services that are traditionally delivered through a wired connection

•	cloud computing typically offers providing the individual, hosted services.

Mobile Computing:
•	Mobile computing is human–computer interaction by which a computer is expected to be transported during normal usage. 
•	Mobile computing involves mobile communication, mobile hardware, and mobile software.
•	 Communication issues include ad hoc and infrastructure networks as well as communication properties,protocols, data formats and concrete technologies.
•	Hardware includes mobile devices or device components.
•	 Mobile software deals with the characteristics and requirements of mobile applications.

•	Mobile computing is taking a physical device with you. This could be a laptop or a mobile phone or some device which enables you to telework – working wherever you go because of the small size of the device you’re using.
